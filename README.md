## What is it?

It's a simple template I created for myself to set up git repositories for Godot 4 engine projects.
It includes .gitignore and .gitattributes files predefined so git handles large assets automatically using Git LFS and ignores common files that you probably should not commit.
It's not an exaustive list of files to ignore nor lfs to track, but it's a good starting point for most of the projects.
I'll continue to add more to it as I need to.
Feel free to contribute and fork it if you find it useful.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in the Godot editor with Git version control
3. Paste .gitignore and .gitattributes files in the root of the project

### Prerequisites

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) 
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (for large assets)

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lithiumfury/GodotGitTemplate.git
```
